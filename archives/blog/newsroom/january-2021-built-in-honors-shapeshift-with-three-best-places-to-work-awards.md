**Built In Honors ShapeShift with Three “Best Places to Work” Awards**<br/>

*Company Recognized for Culture, Compensation and Benefits*

<br/>

**Denver, CO — January 20, 2021 —** [ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.com/), an international, non-custodial cryptocurrency leader, announced that they were honored by Built In’s 2021 Best Places To Work Awards. Specifically, the Denver offices earned recognition as a “Colorado Best Small Company to Work For,” a “Colorado Best Place to Work” and one of “Colorado’s Best Paying Companies.” Built In’s annual, national awards program includes companies of all sizes, from startups to enterprises, in the eight largest tech markets in the United States. <br/>

“Our employees *are* our company in many respects, and we have mutually focused on building a strong community and culture,” said Erik Voorhees, founder and CEO of ShapeShift. “We are pleased to see those efforts being recognized. But much of the recognition goes to the employees themselves: culture is built by the people within it, and we have the best employees in the business. We reward them by ensuring they are well compensated, recognized and supported for their hard work.”<br/>

Built In determines winners for Best Places to Work based on an algorithm that uses company data about compensation, benefits and cultural programs. To reflect the attributes candidates are searching for within the Built In platform today, this year’s program weighted criteria like remote work opportunities and programs for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) more heavily.<br/>

“These companies raise the bar for cultural excellence and the ability to adapt to meet changing needs of employees," said Sheridan Orr, Chief Marketing Officer, Built In. “The 2021 winners show a commitment not just to creating meaningful cultures but to delivering talent needs as they change in a dynamic landscape. We’re thrilled to extend our congratulations to the winners.”   <br/>
