# ShapeShift Publishes Report on Cosmos, Polkadot and NEAR Decentralized Protocols

 *Denver, CO — February 10, 2021 —* [ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.com/), an international, non-custodial cryptocurrency leader, announced the availability of a new, in-depth report titled “[New Frontiers: A Deep Dive Analysis of the Cosmos, Polkadot, and Near Protocols](https://shapeshift.com/reports/new-frontiers).” The analysis reviews three emerging “smart contract blockchains” (or, blockchains that can run a wide variety of decentralized applications). 

While blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum have grown in mindshare, adoption and sophistication, lesser-known blockchains are proliferating. This series will provide blockchain, cryptocurrency and web 3.0 development enthusiasts with an in-depth review of the opportunity and state of evolution of the three emerging platforms. The report is the first of a series called “New Frontiers”; subsequent reports issued later this year will review additional smart contract blockchains and explore related topics.

“New Frontiers: A Deep Dive Analysis of the Cosmos, Polkadot, and Near Protocols” provides readers with an assessment of each protocol’s:<br/>

* Architecture (high-level review)
* Interoperability
* Governance
* Ecosystem
* Token Distribution

“The world of smart contract platforms is buzzing with new entrants—all of which strive to offer the properties of being trust-minimized, censorship-resistant, immutable, permissionless and transparent. These are the qualities that have propelled Ethereum to success,” said Kent Barton, head of Research and Development at ShapeShift and author of the series. “Enthusiasts may want to get involved with these newer blockchains early; but it’s difficult to know which new projects have a strong foundation before they have earned a critical mass of developers, users and projects. This series of reports, while not investment advice, will offer analysis and one view of their potential.”
