**<br/>At** [ShapeShift](http://shapeshift.com/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=shapeshift_platform&utm_term=cta02), we like to show our support for projects that inspire us; creating technology that brings us one step closer to a future filled with cutting edge financial alternatives. Through 2019, we saw some great blockchain projects continue to develop and wanted to share some of our favorites with you to keep an eye on for the year ahead.

## Cosmos

We like Cosmos so much that we recently added [ATOM](https://coincap.io/assets/cosmos) to KeepKey, making it tradeable on the ShapeShift Platform. The project works to improve interoperability between blockchains, allowing them to communicate and transact in a decentralized ‚ÄúInternet of Blockchains.‚Äù To learn more, check out the open-source tools that make this possible like [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/), [Cosmos SDK](https://tendermint.com/sdk/), and [IBC](https://cosmos.network/ibc/).

*‚öõÔ∏è Connect your KeepKey to the* [*ShapeShift Platform*](http://beta.shapeshift.com/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=shapeshift_platform&utm_term=cta03) *and trade dozens of assets for Cosmos (ATOM).*

## Facebook

We don‚Äôt know if Facebook will find success in 2020, or if [Libra](https://libra.org/en-US/) will fail to launch and fade into history. Still, we‚Äôd like to give a nod to the tech giant. Libra has helped build awareness in the crypto space, and put digital currencies at the forefront of the minds of government officials, technologists, and Facebook‚Äôs own audience of over 2 billion people.

## Binance

Binance does a great job engaging their users by offering a coin that powers the Binance Ecosystem. [BNB](https://coincap.io/assets/binance-coin) can be used to pay [transaction fees](https://www.binance.com/en), [credit card bills](https://crypto.com/en/index.html#), [travel expenses](https://blokt.com/news/binance-invests-2-5-million-in-travelbybit-will-bring-crypto-payments-to-major-airports-globally), and much more. Learn about its uses, support options, and burn mechanism [here](https://www.binance.com/en/use-bnb).

## Digibyte

DigiByte was founded in 2014 as a decentralized, fast, and secure way to transact across the world. [DGB](https://coincap.io/assets/digibyte) [claims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=91&v=rmDyhKOjNKM&feature=emb_title) to be 5x‚Äôs more secure than Bitcoin, with state-of-the-art security that integrates the same tech used to secure nuclear launch codes. Aiming to be the Paypal of the blockchain space, DigiByte boasts quick transactions and minimal fees.

##  Maker

According to [Alethio](https://aleth.io/), Maker‚Äôs DAI (now SAI) was the [most traded token](https://medium.com/alethio/dex-in-the-2019-a-recap-by-numbers-96d506ba1cb8) against ETH in 2019, having been traded for over 4.4 million Ethereum. If you‚Äôve been confused through the SAI/DAI transition, here‚Äôs a quick breakdown. Original, single collateral DAI has now become SAI, and DAI now stands for multi-collateral DAI, which is backed by a multitude of assets, rather than just ETH. You can learn more [here](https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-sai-where-is-my-dai-migrating-to-multi-collateral-dai/).<br/>
