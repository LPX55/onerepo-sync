If you’re new to crypto, it can be difficult to get oriented. Plenty of people are out to shill specific coins, and tribalism and maximalism can confuse the senses. Finding good, reliable sources for your crypto news is crucial to developing a well-rounded perspective of what’s being built, allowing you to form your own opinions on the topics at hand.<br/>

To help you out, we’ve put together a list of some of our favorite publications, podcasts, and enthusiasts to start you off on your crypto adventure.<br/> 

## CoinDesk<br/>
