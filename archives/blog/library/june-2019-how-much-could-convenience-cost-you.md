If you're reading this, you’re familiar with how a cryptocurrency exchange works. You’ve seen the memes, jokes, and a lot of drama related to exchanges. It all seems straightforward — but if you have any funds on a custodial exchange, you’re at risk.

In 2018, a record-breaking $1.3 billion was stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges. You would think the problem ultimately rests on the shoulders of custodial exchanges. It’s easy to pass the buck, blaming these exchanges for storing customer funds on computers connected to the Internet.

However, some exchanges have taken action to improve and upgrade security by providing a non-custodial solution and using cold storage. In fact, many advocates for this higher level of security (including [ShapeShift](http://shapeshift.com/?utm_source=content&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=launch&utm_term=cta25)).

While it sucks that certain exchanges take security more seriously than others, it’s time for users to wake up to the risks of keeping crypto on exchange-based hot wallets.<br/> 

## Custodial Exchange — What’s the Big Deal?

* Hackers can access your data and steal your funds. All without leaving their house.
* Exchanges can experience technical problems and you lose access to your funds.
* Exchanges can freeze your wallet for any reason they want — even though it’s your money.

But, that’s what happens when you give away your power to a third-party that’s eager to make a profit. Sadly, it seems many more hacks and tragedies will unfold before there is a large-scale migration toward non-custodial exchanges as a clear solution.<br/>

## The Original Exchange Hack & Aftershocks

[The Mt. Gox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox) exchange hack shook the crypto community to its core and many are still fighting back to attain their lost funds. Even with this lesson learned — what’s different? Not very much. However, we can glean two important truths from this historic hack.

* **TRUTH —** The **obvious lack of security** regarding custodial exchanges.
* **TRUTH —** The **bountiful opportunity for hackers**, who understandably love the truth above.<br/> 

## “Don’t Get GOXED”

Seriously, this is getting old.How many times will the crypto community get GOXED before realizing that if you don’t *hold* your coins in your *own* wallet — you don’t*own* your crypto.

***The expression “not your keys, not your crypto” remains as true as ever.***

It’s your sole responsibility — no one else’s — to reclaim sovereignty over your crypto. Make sure you withdraw your holdings from any exchange accounts and transfer them into cold storage. *Please, don’t gloss over this.*

As you continue on your journey, remember to do your homework. Educate yourself and educate others.
