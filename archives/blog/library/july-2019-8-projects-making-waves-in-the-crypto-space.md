<br/>If you’re new to the crypto community, keep this in mind: things move fast. Regulation is ever-evolving and groundbreaking technology is constantly being built.

To help you keep up, we’ve created a shortlist of some of the coolest projects that are making waves in the crypto space.<br/> 

[![Try the Brave Browser — now compatiable with the new ShapeShift Platform.](https://assets.website-files.com/5e9a09610b7dce71f87f7f17/5e9fd184ce03630ce185f5a0_1*6L5Q8lbReFmpxc4v98xuig.png)](https://brave.com/)We’re pretty excited about [**Brave**](https://brave.com/) — so excited that we’ve made [our new platform](http://shapeshift.com/?utm_source=content&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=launch&utm_term=cta14) compatible with the Brave Browser! If you haven’t heard of Brave, it’s your private, safe web browser that blocks 3rd party ads — for free. It seeks to revolutionize how web publishers make money for users. This is done via voluntary micro-payments using the [Basic Attention (BAT) token](https://coincap.io/assets/basic-attention-token). This means that paywalls, annoying pop-ups, and ads that intrude on your privacy can be a thing of the past.
