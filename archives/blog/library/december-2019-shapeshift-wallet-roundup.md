***Some describe the crypto space as the new wild, wild west and we‚Äôre aiming to make it a little more manageable.***

The [ShapeShift Platform](http://shapeshift.com/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=fox_launch&utm_term=cta31) is a web-based tool that supports multiple wallets for easy trading and crypto management. All of ShapeShift‚Äôs wallet integrations have two important things in common. The first is that **you control your private keys**, which means you control your crypto regardless of which wallet you choose. Second, all wallets paired with a verified account get 100 [FOX tokens](https://shapeshift.com/fox-token?utm_source=social&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=fox_launch&utm_term=cta34) and **commission free trading**.

**Ready to trade for free?** Discover what kind of wallet you need and which of our wallet partners is right for you: Portis, KeepKey, Ledger, or Trezor.<br/> 

## üÉè Pick a Wallet, Any Wallet

First things first, decide which type of self-custody wallet suits your fancy, and meets your security needs.

## Web-based wallet

Portis is our web-based solution. It allows you to generate a new wallet in seconds and is accessible anywhere you sign in. Your private key is stored online in hot storage. This is the best option for mobile.

## Hardware wallet

A hardware wallet is a physical device that stores your private keys offline in cold storage. We‚Äôre excited to support the leading hardware wallets on our platform ‚Äî KeepKey, Ledger, and Trezor.<br/> 

## ü§† Howdy Partners!

We‚Äôve partnered with the crypto‚Äôs favorite self-custody wallet solutions and integrated them directly into the ShapeShift Platform. Why do we only support **self-custody** wallets? We want you to be in charge of your own financial sovereignty. You control your keys, you control your crypto.

## Portis

Our integration with [Portis](http://portis.io/) software wallet transformed the platform into an instantly accessible crypto management tool for anyone, anywhere. You can trade, track, and hodl Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other ERC-20 tokens. Get started in seconds by generating a new wallet with only a username and password. If you forget your password, you‚Äôll have to use your private key to access your funds, so make sure to keep it somewhere extra safe.

## Ledger

Ledger has helped bring advanced hardware security to the crypto masses and was one of the most requested wallets by our users. Ledger Nano S and Ledger Nano X owners who create a [ShapeShift account](https://auth.shapeshift.io/signup?utm_source=social&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=fox_launch&utm_term=cta32) will receive 100 [FOX tokens](https://shapeshift.com/fox-token?utm_source=social&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=fox_launch&utm_term=cta34), which allow for up to $1,000 in [free trading](https://shapeshift.com/free-trading?utm_source=social&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=fox_launch&utm_term=cta33) every month in the ShapeShift Platform.

## Trezor

[**Trezor**](https://trezor.io/start/) was the first hardware wallet on the market and is still a favorite amongst crypto OGs. Both models of Trezor are supported in the ShapeShift Platform. Once you pair your Trezor, you only need to plug it in when signing transactions. Even without an account, users can still track, send, receive, and secure their crypto for free. Trezor users who create a [ShapeShift account](https://auth.shapeshift.io/signup?utm_source=social&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=fox_launch&utm_term=cta32) will receive 100 [FOX tokens](https://shapeshift.com/fox-token?utm_source=social&utm_medium=medium&utm_campaign=fox_launch&utm_term=cta34).
