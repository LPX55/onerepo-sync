**Devcon**, the worldâ€™s largest Ethereum conference is finally here, and where else could it be other than Japan? This may just be the only country in the world that can keep up with the creatives from the Ethereum community. With [Devcon](https://devcon.org/) around the corner and so many awesome events, weâ€™ve compiled a list of meetups, parties, and events you donâ€™t want to miss in Osaka.

*>>> View the* [*Devcon agenda*](http://agenda/) *for details about speaker tracks and workshops.*
