<h1>I'm on Windows 7 and I'm Having Trouble with My KeepKey. Can You Help?</h1>
<div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p>If you are having trouble with your KeepKey and you are using Windows 7, we recommend upgrading your operating system to Windows 10. Windows is <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4057281/windows-7-support-will-end-on-january-14-2020" target="_self">eliminating support for Windows 7</a></strong>, and because of this, we recommend using Windows 10 for KeepKey and ShapeShift.com. If you do attempt to use the ShapeShift platform or the KeepKey Chrome Client with Windows 7, our team may be limited in our troubleshooting capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need help upgrading to Windows 10, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12435/windows-10-upgrade-faq" target="_self">this FAQ</a></strong> may be of help.</p></div>
