<h1>Why is the Case of the Letters Different on My ETH Address in the ShapeShift  Platform vs KeepKey?</h1>
<div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p><span>First and foremost, there is no need to worry. This mixed case feature is a way of identifying typos in the address. Ethereum wallet addresses are in hex [0-9 A-F]*. While the address itself is case-insensitive ("</span><span>A"</span><span> is the same as "</span><span>a"</span><span> to the network), the case sensitivity is used as an optional checksum. It was built as an after-thought to an addressing scheme that lacked basic checksum validation.</span></p>
<p><span>Keep in mind that all Ethereum addresses are <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><strong>NOT</strong></span> case sensitive. Enter the address in which the address is not case sensitive - though both will work!</span></p></div>
