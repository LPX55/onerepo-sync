<h1>What is a KeepKey Label? Why Does it Matter?</h1>
<div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p><span>Upon plugging in your KeepKey, you will be prompted to enter your PIN. Enter it and click �Submit�.</span></p>
<p><span>You will now have the option to create a label for your device. You can name it whatever you�d like. Once you've typed your label of choice, click �Save�.</span></p>
<p><span>If you choose to label the KeepKey, you can receive funds without having the device plugged in. The balance will also update without the device being connected. If you choose �No Thanks�, all portfolio data will be erased once you unplug your KeepKey. You will need to connect it again in order to see your balance.</span></p>

<p><span>If you would like to remove your saved KeepKey from the platform, you can do so by going to "Settings". Next, click on �Forget� beside the Linked KeepKey you would wish to unpair. Please keep in mind that you can pair multiple KeepKeys to the platform.</span></p>
