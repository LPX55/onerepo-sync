<h1>How Long Do I Need to Hold Down the Button on My KeepKey?</h1>
<div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p><span>KeepKey's large display gives clarity to every digital asset leaving the device. Each transaction must be manually approved using KeepKey's confirmation button.</span></p>

<p><span>When asked to confirm or �sign� a transaction, you will first need to verify that the address on the KeepKey matches the one you see on your computer screen in the ShapeShift Platform. </span></p>
<p><span>After confirming these match, hold down the button and you will see a clocklike animation begin. Let go of the button after this animation has ended. Then, you�re all set!</span></p></div>
