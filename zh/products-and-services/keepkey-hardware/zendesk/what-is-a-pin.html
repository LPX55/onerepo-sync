<h1>What Is A PIN?</h1>
<div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p>All KeepKey devices are protected with a PIN as a barrier to entry for that specific device. The PIN is a combination of up to 9 numbers that you select after initializing your KeepKey. A PIN protects your device against unauthorized use in the event your KeepKey falls into the wrong hands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>You can select a PIN between 1-9 digits -&nbsp;We recommend a PIN length of at least 6 digits.</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will see a randomized, scrambled keypad on your KeepKey display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Example: If you'd like to choose the number "6" you would have to click the top left box.</em></strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://keepkey.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360000336180/Screen_Shot_2017-03-27_at_11.07.23_AM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2017-03-27_at_11.07.23_AM.png" width="239" height="288"><img src="https://keepkey.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360000341239/product2_large.jpg" alt="product2_large.jpg" width="384" height="288"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>Even if your KeepKey is stolen, it cannot be accessed without the correct PIN. In addition, the number placement is re-scrambled at random each time you connect your device, so even a key-logger cannot decipher your PIN because the numbers are only shown on the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can enter your PIN with confidence on an infected computer. Even if your computer became infected with malware or spyware (such as key-logging software), your PIN would remain safe.</p>
<p>Let's look at the cipher. This will change every time you use your KeepKey. Your PIN is limited to nine digits. If you are trying to use a PIN longer than nine digits, please note that the device only recognizes the first nine entries.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360002385740/Screen_Shot_2019-05-21_at_2.08.17_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2019-05-21_at_2.08.17_PM.png" width="501" height="375"></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong>Note that the new security update will include two identical number boxes displayed on your KeepKey's screen (example below)</strong></p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><strong><img src="https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360017530620/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_3.31.26_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_3.31.26_PM.png"></strong></p>
<p>Your screen will look like this.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360002385720/Screen_Shot_2019-05-21_at_2.04.55_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2019-05-21_at_2.04.55_PM.png" width="270" height="433"></p>
<p>To follow the cipher on the KeepKey, each of those buttons will actually be representative of what is shown on the KeepKey's screen. In our example, it would look like this.</p>
<p class="wysiwyg-text-align-center"><img src="https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/article_attachments/360002471119/Screen_Shot_2019-05-21_at_2.25.36_PM.png" alt="Screen_Shot_2019-05-21_at_2.25.36_PM.png"></p>
<p>After you choose and confirm your PIN (remember: the cipher will change before the confirmation screen, so make sure you take a look at your KeepKey screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, the scrambled number placement is only shown on the KeepKey device itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Never share your PIN or recovery sentence with anyone.</strong></p></div>
