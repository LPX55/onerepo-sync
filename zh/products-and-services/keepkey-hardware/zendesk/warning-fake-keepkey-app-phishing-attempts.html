<h1>Warning: Fake KeepKey App Phishing Attempts</h1>
<div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p><span>Please be aware of fraudulent KeepKey apps in the Chrome Store. It is essential to use only the official software client for your KeepKey: </span><a href="http://beta.shapeshift.com"><span>The ShapeShift Platform. </span></a><span>We will </span><strong>never</strong><span> ask you for your 12 word seed phrase, if anyone does that is a scam. Phishing attempts, such as these fake wallet apps, can lead to users losing their crypto.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://beta.shapeshift.com/"><span>The ShapeShift Platform</span></a></p>
<p><span>The ShapeShift Platform is the recommended, cutting edge interface for KeepKey. Visit </span><a href="https://beta.shapeshift.com/"><span>beta.shapeshift.com</span></a><span> to connect your KeepKey. Depending on your KeepKey, you may be prompted to update your bootloader and firmware by downloading the KeepKey Updater App.</span></p>

<p><br><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepkey-client/idgiipeogajjpkgheijapngmlbohdhjg"><span>The KeepKey Client</span></a></p>
<p><span>The KeepKey Client is available in the Chrome web store. It was the original client for interacting with your KeepKey hardware wallet. However, beginning in June 2020, Google will be ending support for the Chrome Apps. We recommend all KeepKey Chrome App Client users move to the ShapeShift Platform. The platform allows you to send, receive, trade, and securely hold your KeepKey assets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Beware, there are fake KeepKey chrome apps available to download, so make sure you only use the <span class="wysiwyg-color-blue"><a href="http://beta.shapeshift.com/" target="_self" rel="undefined">ShapeShift Platform</a> </span>for your KeepKey.</strong></span></p>
