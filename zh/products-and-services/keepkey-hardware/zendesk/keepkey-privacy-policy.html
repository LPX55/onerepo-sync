<h1>KeepKey Privacy Policy</h1>
<div class="article-content">
          <div class="article-body"><p><strong>Online Privacy Notice</strong></p>
<p>Data protection and security are important to Key Hodlers, LLC (�KeepKey�; �we�), as is your trust in our company and services. KeepKey is committed to processing your personal data responsibly and in compliance with legal requirements.</p>
<p>This Online Privacy Notice describes how we collect and process your personal data when you use our website https://shapeshift.io/keepkey/ (including any sub-sites and related extensions thereof; �the website�).</p>
<p><strong>Personal data we collect and process in order to make the website available</strong></p>
<p>You can visit the website and obtain information about our services without telling us who you are. As with any connection with a webserver, however, the server on which we host the website automatically logs and temporarily stores certain technical data.</p>
<p>Technical data that is stored includes the IP address and operating system of your device, the data and time of access, or the type of browser you use to access the website. This is required for technical reasons to make the website available to you.

<p>Our website uses fonts by Google LLC (�Google�) (�Google Fonts�). To integrate Google Fonts into the website, your browser establishes a connection to the Google server. In doing so, the IP address of your device is transmitted to Google. Google logs records of font queries and protects this data from unauthorized access. Google analyzes aggregated data to optimize Google Fonts and identify which websites use Google Fonts. Further information on Google Fonts can be found here: https://fonts.google.com.

<p>This may include your full name, your shipping and billing address, your phone number, your e-mail address, and your credit card information.</p>

Further, based on our legitimate interest to inform our customers and partners about new developments, products, services or offers, we will send you certain commercial information (e.g. our newsletter or blog posts). However, you may at any time opt-out of receiving such information.</p>

<p><strong>With whom we share your personal data</strong></p>
<p>In connection with the offers and services provided on the website, to protect our legitimate interests or to fulfill legal requirements, it may be necessary to share your personal data with our affiliate ShapeShift Global Limited, with business partners of KeepKey, as well as with applicable public authorities and law enforcement upon receipt of a facially valid formal law enforcement request.</p>

<p>Further, to the extent we are requested by public authorities or courts and legally required to do so, we will share your personal data with them or other third parties.</p>
<p>The data sharing may include transfers to companies or organizations in countries without an adequate standard of data protection.
