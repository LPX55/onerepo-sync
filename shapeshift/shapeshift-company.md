# ShapeShift (Company) History

## Formation and Early Stages

ShapeShift was a U.S. based cryptocurrency exchange registered in Switzerland in 2014. The company, under the leadership of Erik Voorhees and co-founder "Jon Shapeshift," launched its initial version in the summer of 2014 with Litecoin as the first altcoin available for instant swaps to and from Bitcoin. Initially ShapeShift was "primarily intended to be used as an API" according to archives.

> ShapeShift is a new piece of infrastructure in Bitcoinland. It is how digital currency exchange should work. From start to finish you can change currencies in under ten seconds, no account required. - *About Us Page Circa Aug. 2014*

A few months after the initial launch, Peercoin, Darkcoin, and Dogecoin was added to the list of asset offerings. By September 2015 the exchange offered 40 different assets with over 900 different trading pairs--by far the most of any crypto exchanges at the time.

### Digital Currency Group Investment

In March 2015, ShapeShift received its first funding with a $525,000 seed investment from Digital Currency Group, a New York-based venture capital fund led by Barry Silbert and Roger Ver. 

### CoinPayments Partnership

In May 2015 ShapeShift entered into a partnership with CoinPayments.net, a leading cryptocurrency merchant system still in operation today. 

> "We are excited to offer simple and frictionless conversions to our customers using the ShapeShift API,” said CoinPayments.net CEO Alex Alexandrov, “This partnership gets us one step closer to a system where customer can pay in any currency they choose and vendors settle in what they find most convenient for their business."

### iOS App Release

On June 9th 2015, ShapeShift announced the launch of its platform on iOS, boasting that iPhone users can now trade "every major digital asset at the touch of a button." 

> “Most exchanges hold customer funds and extract personal information, which is an archaic and insecure model,” added Voorhees. “Mt. Gox was a teachable moment for everyone in the Bitcoin community and ShapeShift has innovated these problems out of the picture. We are both faster and more secure. This is real consumer protection - no funds or sensitive information is stored on our servers nor on the user’s phone in case it is damaged, destroyed or stolen. Digital currency has brought to humanity a more secure infrastructure, and so we build in that spirit.”

### Spells of Genesis Cards

On August 11th, 2015, Spells of Genesis, a trading card and arcade game that integrated Bitcoin and blockchain, announced its plans to release and sell a limited quantity of ShapeShift-inspired cards. These extremely rare cards gave an early glimpse of the forecoming NFT boom, nearly half a decade later. Plans to burn and auction off some of these cards were announced and approved in November 2021. 

>“Digital goods in games have always had fake scarcity,” explains ShapeShift’s CEO Erik Voorhees, “the company can always create more, and nobody really knows how many exist, making it impractical to value or price. These blockchain-based digital assets, however, are truly mathematically scarce, and will become commoditized and traded like other financial assets. Spells of Genesis is breaking exciting new ground and we’re thrilled to be working closely with them.”

## Regulatory Roadblocks and Opposition

### New York's BitLicense

In July 2014, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYSDFS) announced its plans to regulate businesses involved in virtual currency activities. The controversial "BitLicense" was met with fierce opposition when finalized in 2015, including ShapeShift, ultimately leading to the announcement that it would cease offering services to New York residents as a result of regulatory framework. Voorhees described the customer data requirements imposed by the BitLicense as “Orwellian” and a reckless data collection effort.
