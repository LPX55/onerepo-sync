# Translation Bounties
Until you are nominated to become a GlobalFOX Community Ambassador, your input to the workstream are technically counted as bounty contributions. We strongly believe that all work and efforts should be fairly compensated. 

> As a DAO workstream that is exploring completely new processes and ideas, hiccups are bound to happen, and processes will most likely change as we mature. We appreciate your patience and understanding as these kinks are worked out over time.

1. Bounty rewards per candidate can not accumulate to more than the baseline GCA compensation
2. High priority content items will have more weight than non-priority content items
3. Document difficulty will impact the overall bounty reward; wordcount and length of the document will also impact the overall bounty amount
4. Third party quality checks may dock points off your bounty reward if the quality does not meet a certain standard; there are two third party peer reviewers per (most) languages that have will be given an evaluation sheet to fill out for grading transparency. 
5. Promptness while maintaining accuracy will impact the overall score. For high priority items, there will be a bounty decay rate. We reserve the right to bring in a third party translator from our growing list of professional translators if no progress is being made.
