# Information and Globalization Workstream

ShapeShift is an organization with a colorful history, highly respected leaders in the blockchain industry, and various top-of-the-line product/service offerings. As the company transitions into a fully decentralized organization, it is up to us, the community, to remain organized and efficient.

Information, the preservation of information, and the systematic process of sharing information has been the glue of human civilization and is arguably one of the most important functions in any organization, whether it be a for-profit corporation or a team of lawyers working on a case.

This workstream was proposed and passed with several objectives that will undoubtedly have long-term benefits for the DAO. Welcome, and be proud of what you are contributing to!

> Information is power only if you can take action with it. Then, and only then, does it represent knowledge and, consequently, power. - Daniel Burrus

Before anything else, you should first get familiarized with the inception of this workstream, and its original proposal. A lot of answers to questions that many of you have are laid out in the proposal.

# Contributing to the Workstream

There are various ways to contribute to our workstream. Most of you reading this are here because of your interest in becoming a Global Fox Representative. Let's go over some these and get familiarized with some key concepts first.

## Contributing as a Bounty Contributer

Our workstream is working with a few other DAO leaders to figure out the best way to approach a content bounty and reward system that is fair and transparent. More details will be provided when available. 

The mid-term goal is to track all contributions through anonymous accounts that are cryptographically signed, whether through MetaMask or Portis. The content reward would also need to be calculated by a weight system of A) the importance, priority, and difficulty of the said content that is bountied; B) a decentralized version of our document history and versioning system (the current email/password authentication system is only temporary).

These bounties will not be limited to non-English languages. Although translation and spreading information globally is arguably the most important aspect of this workstream, we are language-agnostistic. Information is what we seek to organize, and information is what we seek to provide.

## Contributing as a GlobalFOX Community Ambassador

<br />

### What is the GlobalFOX Community Ambassador ("GCA") program? 

The <abbr title="GlobalFOX Community Ambassador">GCA</abbr> program is fancy name for the DAO-funded initiative to collect and translate all documents relevant to ShapeShift, our services and products, our governance system, DeFi, and blockchain in general. The positions for the GCA roles are paid, and thus the responsibility and expectations of contribution in translation work as well as community engagement is multitudes higher than a Bounty Contributer. We expeect all GCAs to become active participants of the ShapeShift DAO, represent the DAO with professionalism and friendliness at all times, and hopefully become future leaders yourselves. GCAs play a crucial role in bridging the language and cultural barriers between international visotors and the DAO, and we sincerely hope that all GCAs are passionate about educating and welcoming more members of your local communities into our DAO.

<br />

### Becoming a GlobalFOX Community Ambassador

If you are interested in becoming a potential GCA, please read the following carefully. Anyone can apply to become a GCA, but statistically, not many will make it to the *esteemed* position. ðŸ˜‰

As previously mentioned many times through many channels, we are first and foremost looking for Ambassadors that are:

1. Actively participating in the DAO, even if it's just through discussions and getting to know the members.
2. Passionate about blockchain, decentralization, and helping others through education on the freedom that these technologies bring us.
3. Always eager to learn more and enjoys staying up to date with the latest developments around the industry.
4. Of course, your language & translation skill level must be profecient enough to be able to produce quality content that will be regularly checked and graded via 3rd party peer reviewers.  

Sound like something you are up for? Awesome, let's continue.

> GCAs are expected to put in anywhere from 25-50 hours a week. Those that go above and beyond will be eligible for a compensation increase when budgets are being re-allocated and adjusted (every four months).

<br />

### Application and Candidacy Process

All potential candidates must first submit an expression of interest and follow the steps outlined below.

- **1. Submit Expression of Interest** - This process shouldn't take longer than 5 to 10 minutes, as we only ask basic questions to begin to get to know you. [Link to the form ðŸ”—](https://foxte.am)
- **2. Remain Active in our Community (specifically our Discord and Discourse)** - This gives us a time to get to know you better. If everything is going well, the applicant will become a **Potential Candidate.**
- **3. Every few weeks, at the workstreams discretion (we do not have a set quota target, we want to organically grow GCA leaders), nominees will be announced.** - If you are nominated to become a GCA, it means you have shown great passion, drive, and actively engaged with the community. The nominated member will then move from a Potential Candidate status to a Nominated Candidate.
- **4. Nominated Candidates will go through a final two-week probationary period in which language profeciency and work ethic will be judged.** - Translation work is hard, especially in fields of emerging technology like blockchain. We do not expect perfect translation work, but a certain level of quality must be met. Our third party peer reviewers will provide a general report and have an important say in the decision, but ultimately the final decision will be made by the workstream and other peer reviews may be requested for a second opinion.

> GCAs may be terminated from his/her role if there is no production and engagement. If at any point in the entire process you feel you have been unfairly treated, misunderstood, or wronged, first bring it up to the workstream leaders and make your appeal. If your appeal is denied, we encourage you to follow our standard DAO protocols to initiate a discussion and then a formal vote to be reinstated. These situations are highly unlikely to occur, but you can be assuredd that there's a democratic process! 
{.is-warning}

<br />

### Compensation 

- As stated in the proposal, all GCAs will begin with a monthly compensation of $1,500. Payments will go out on the 15th of each month, in alignment with other workstreams. 
- Foxes that make it to the GCA stage will go through a Colony onboarding process (for payments).

<br />

### Term Limits

Every member of the team, starting from the leader down to the language leaders, will have a term-limit of 4 months.

- Term Limit - 4 months after initiation date
- Evaluation and review of the workstream leaders as well as the workstream itself every four months.
- If any leader or team member is underperforming and/or not fulfilling his or her duties, any DAO member can raise up the issue and the DAO can take necessary measures to either correct or replace the member.
- GCAs will have the chance to receive a compensation raise at the end of the first term of up to $500 (bringing it up to a total $2K per month) depending on the quality of work, reliability, speediness, professionalism, and community participation that was exercised.
